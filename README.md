# Phasor-Calculator -- EE201 -- Cal-Poly

I made this calculator to solve AC circuit anysis and filter problems. The code is broken up into modules that handle a specific type of problem. With this calculator you can solve AC steady state circuit problems the same as there DC counterparts without having to wory about complex math.

## Features
* Adding AC voltages and currents
* Adding of impedances
* Calculating AC power and Power angle
* Calculating Filter constants and outputs given an AC input
